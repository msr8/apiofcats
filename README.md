# Introduction

Hello there! This is a site for cat images and videos.
If you want to check out a random picture/video stored in the evergrowing library, you can do so by going to [/random](https://apiofcats.xyz/random). Once there, you can constantly refresh the page (ctrl+R or cmd+R) to get new cat pics/vids :). I got all the images/videos through public sources (mostly reddit) and I DO NOT claim ownership of any of them
